            The best routine for the gym is one that is flexible with your schedule and you actually enjoy. These two factors will contribute greatly to your ability to be consistent with your workouts. Consistency with your workouts and progressing as you perform them is what will lead to results.

That being said, there are plenty of great workout program styles one can do to build muscle, lose fat, or build strength. The body composition goals (building muscle and losing fat) will be accomplished through similar style workouts combined with differing nutritional principles, while those looking for strength gains may need to focus on programs that are centered on the idea of specificity.

To sum that statement up, if you want to change your body composition, you‚Äôll want to train with volume. If you want to build strength, you‚Äôll want a program that is strength specific for the lifts you want to improve such as the bench press, squat and deadlift.
